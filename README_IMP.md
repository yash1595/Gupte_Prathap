1. src and headers contain the original code due for Friday.
2. src_modify contains the modified code as a part of report submission.
3. while uploading src_modify, contents of src were also modified accidently. This updated the code submitted on FRiday to be updated.
   To resolve this, I re-uploaded the older version of the code back in src. As a result, there is a commit in src today on 10/07/2018.
